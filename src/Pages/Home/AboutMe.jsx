          I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of North Texas, passionate about solving complex problems creatively. 
          My journey includes developing software in finance, supply chain, and web design. I've published a paper, joined a hackathon, 
          and built an app for the homeless. At TransUnion, I used .NET Core for data processing and credit reports, and at Larsen & Toubro Infotech,
           I optimized APIs. I'm keen on learning generative AI and object storage. Outside work, I love exploring nature, traveling, and swimming.
            I'm seeking opportunities in 2024 to make a meaningful impact. Let's connect!
