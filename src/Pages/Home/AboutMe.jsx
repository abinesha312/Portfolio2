          <p className="hero--section-description">
          As a Master of Computer Science candidate at the University of North Texas, 
          I am driven by a passion for solving complex problems with innovative solutions. 
          My background in software development spans various domains, including financial services, 
          supply chain management, and web design. I have published a journal paper, participated in a hackathon, 
          and developed a pandemic-focused application for the homeless during my Bachelor's in Information Technology.
           My recent role as an Associate Software Developer at TransUnion involved leveraging .NET Core to process 
           vast user traction data and generate detailed credit reports, specializing in back-end services and data accuracy.

          Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at Larsen & Toubro Infotech, where I optimized APIs, redesigned workbench pages,
           and developed a progressive web app. I am an avid learner, continuously expanding my skills in generative AI and object storage.
           I have conducted a game-changing webinar at Oracle and frequently share my expertise through writing. Outside of tech, 
           I am an explorer of the great outdoors, a traveler, a swimmer, and a life enthusiast. I am actively seeking full-time, co-op, 
           and summer internship opportunities in 2024 to apply my knowledge, skills, and creativity to real-world challenges and make a positive impact.
           Let's connect and build a brighter future together!
